# Fabric Stock Hub

**Fabric Stock Hub** is a full-stack AI-assisted application that manages and promotes fabric stock. The main purpose of the app is to:

-   Keep track of all user stock operations, accounting, and data storage
-   Provide an additional service through a customized AI agent that processes user data and responds to user instructions
-   Serve as a hub connecting stock owners with warehousing and transportation services, plus a promotion section

## Problems Addressed

Some of the problems the app addresses include:

-   Networking all fabric trading operations
-   Streamlining logistics
-   Tracking all user operations

## Technologies Used

The app will be built using technologies like **React, TypeScript, Redux, and Laravel** to ensure a fully operational platform.

## Features

The landing page will feature registration and login functionality. During registration, users can select one or all three options to register as:

1. **Stock User**
2. **Transporter**
3. **Warehouse Provider**

Once logged in as a regular user, they will be welcomed by a chatbot that can either:

-   Answer user instructions through AI assistance, or
-   Allow users to conduct business manually
